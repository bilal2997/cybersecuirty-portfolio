**Description:** Captures the Windows Server 2019 installation process within Oracle VirtualBox. Shows successful OS deployment that will serve as the foundation for the domain controller and essential network services.

3. **System Configuration**  
![System Configuration](https://github.com/bilal2997/cybersecuirty-portfolio/blob/main/active-directory-lab/lab%201%20screenshot%203.png?raw=true)  
**Description:** Displays the Server 2019 system properties confirming the evaluation version installation, hardware allocation (2GB RAM), and basic system identification. Important for documenting the lab environment specifications.

4. **IPv4 Network Configuration**  
![IPv4 Network Configuration](./screenshots/04-ipv4-configuration.png)  
**Description:** Shows the TCP/IPv4 configuration for the internal network interface. Documents the static IP assignment (`172.16.0.1`), subnet mask (`255.255.255.0`), and DNS settings that establish the domain controller's network identity.

5. **Active Directory Management Console**  
![Active Directory Management](./screenshots/05-ad-management.png)  
**Description:** The Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) console showing the domain structure, organizational units, and user accounts. Demonstrates practical AD management including OU design and user object management.

6. **RAS/NAT Configuration**  
![RAS/NAT Configuration](./screenshots/06-ras-nat-configuration.png)  
**Description:** Routing and Remote Access configuration showing NAT setup that enables internet connectivity for the internal network while maintaining security. Critical for enterprise network design understanding.

7. **DHCP Management Console**  
![DHCP Management](./screenshots/07-dhcp-management.png)  
**Description:** DHCP server management showing scope configuration, IP address range (`172.16.0.100-200`), and options including gateway and DNS server settings. Demonstrates dynamic IP allocation setup for client machines.

8. **PowerShell Automation Script**  
![PowerShell Automation](./screenshots/08-powershell-automation.png)  
**Description:** Showcases the custom PowerShell script that automates bulk user creation (1,000+ users) from a text file. Highlights scripting skills and automation capabilities for enterprise user management.

9. **Client Domain Join**  
![Client Domain Join](./screenshots/09-client-domain-join.png)
